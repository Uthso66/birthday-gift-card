# CSS + HTML to make a webpage about a birthday gift.
## This project showcases the general information about the birthday girl and shows my appreciation towards her. Sorry to say that but the image of the girl is AI-generated.😂😂😂😂😂

This project is an example project built alongside Scrimba's HTML + CSS course. Where they teach about HTML and CSS with hands-on projects. While following their tutorial I created my version of the project they showcased. This project shows how to do the following.

* Create a custom webpage for Giftcard.
* Exporting beautiful fonts from the outside and linking them with HTML and CSS.
* Make the picture circle with padding.
* Centering divs with a display option and without using an inheritance from the body tag.
* flex box column settings.
* Hover effect ( When pointing the arrow to an image changing that image), Shade usage.
* Adding animation to the page.
* Using class and id to make the tag unique and variable.
* Genuine fun project for beginners.
